XeLaTeX CV class with flexible layout. Fork me!

![example_scaled.png](https://github.com/viccuad/viccuad-cv/raw/master/example_scaled.png)

Based on the aesthetics of Adrien Friggeri CV found at
[https://github.com/afriggeri/CV](https://github.com/afriggeri/CV)

Although the aesthetics are quite similar, it is done in a very different way:

 - no usage of TikZ package for placing text. That doesn't allow correct 
serialization of the text.

 - usage of Flowfram package to set the layout of the CV. This allows for having a very flexible layout with multiple frames.

The most relevant changes from his work are:

 - CV now is completely serializable.

 - the text flow follows the given frames, and spans to additional pages if 
necessary. 

 - added automatic \pdfcreationdate population. It works in xelatex 
or pdflatex.
 
## Features
 - Flexible layout.
 - Correct serialization of text, thanks to Flowfram.
 - Automatic flow of text, thanks to Flowfram. Text flow follows the given frames, and spans to additional pages if neccesary.
 - XeLaTeX usage.
 - Automatic \pdfcreationdate population in XeLaTeX (there is no way to get current modification date inside XeLaTeX, this fixes it).
 - Correct A4paper layout.
 - Custom \section and \subsection. new \entrylistdated and \entrylist environments.

## Flow
The text flow inside of the CV can be seen in flow.png.
