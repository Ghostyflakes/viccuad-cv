Fork me!\r\n\r\n![example_scaled.png](https://github.com/viccuad/viccuad-cv/raw/master/example_scaled.png)\r\n\r\nBased on the aesthetics of Adrien Friggeri CV found at\r\n[https://github.com/afriggeri/CV](https://github.com/afriggeri/CV)\r\n\r\nAlthough the aesthetics are quite similar, it is done in a very different way:\r\n\r\n - no usage of TikZ package for placing text. That doesn't allow correct \r\nserialization of the text.\r\n\r\n - usage of Flowfram package to set the layout of the CV. This allows for having a very flexible layout with multiple frames.\r\n\r\nThe most relevant changes from his work are:\r\n\r\n - CV now is completely serializable.\r\n\r\n - the text flow follows the given frames, and spans to additional pages if \r\nnecessary. \r\n\r\n - added automatic \\pdfcreationdate population. It works in xelatex \r\nor pdflatex.\r\n \r\n## Features\r\n - Flexible layout.\r\n - Correct serialization of text, thanks to Flowfram.\r\n - Automatic flow of text, thanks to Flowfram. Text flow follows the given frames, and spans to additional pages if neccesary.\r\n - XeLaTeX usage.\r\n - Automatic \\pdfcreationdate population in XeLaTeX (there is no way to get current modification date inside XeLaTeX, this fixes it).\r\n - Correct A4paper layout.\r\n - Custom \\section and \\subsection. new \\entrylistdated and \\entrylist environments.\r\n\r\n## Flow\r\nThe text flow inside of the CV can be seen in flow.png.\r\n\r\n## Examples \r\n * Of an empty draft: example-drafton.tex & example-drafton.pdf\r\n * Of a complete CV: example.tex & example.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n## Revisions\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n\r\n * Initial version\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright(C) 2013  VÃ­ctor Cuadrado Juan \r\n\r\nIn addition of the LaTeX Project Public License, this work CANNOT be used for a commercial use. \r\n\r\nThis work may be distributed and/or modified under the\r\nconditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\r\nof this license or (at your option) any later version.\r\nThe latest version of this license is in\r\nhttp://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\r\nand version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\r\nversion 2005/12/01 or later.\r\n\r\nThis work consists of the files viccuad-cv.cls and creationdate.lua \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
